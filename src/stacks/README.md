# Stacks

- A stack is an Abstract Data Type that holds a collection of items (like ints) where the elements are always added to one end.

- Just like a stack of plates, the last item pushed onto the top of a stack is the first item to be removed.

- Stack operations
    - put something on top of the stack (PUSH)
    - remove the top item (POP)
    - look at the top item, without removing it
    - check to see if the stack is empty
