# Stacks

- A stack is an Abstract Data Type that holds a collection of items (like ints) where the elements are always added to one end.

- Just like a stack of plates, the last item pushed onto the top of a stack is the first item to be removed.

- Stack operations:

    - put something on top of the stack (PUSH).
    - remove the top item (POP).
    - look at the top item, without removing it.
    - check to see if the stack is empty.

# Common use cases

- Undo in your word processor.

- Evaluating math expressions.

- Converting from infix expressions to postfix expressions.

- Tracking where to return from C++ function calls.

- They are so fundamental that a stack is hard-wired into every CPU.

- Solving mazes (explores the last x,y location pushed on top of the stack first).
