## Tree Basics

- A Tree is a special linked list-based data structure.
- Common use cases: 
    - Organize hierarchical data.
    - Make information easily searchable.
    - Simplify evaluation of math expressions.
    - To make decisions (decision tree).

## Binary Tree

- A Binary Tree is a special form of tree. In a binary tree, every node has at most two children nodes.

## Full Binary Tree

- A full binary tree is one in which every leaf node has the same depth, and every non-leaf has exactly two children.

## Binary Search Tree

- A Binary Search Tree is a type of Binary Tree with specific properties that make them very efficient to search for a value in the tree.

- For every node X in the tree:
    - All nodes in X's left subtree must be less than X.
    - All nodes in X's right subtree must be greater than X.

# Binary Search Tree Operations

- Determine if the binary search tree is empty.
- Search the binary search tree for a value.
- Insert an item in the binary search tree.
- Delete an item from the binary search tree.
- Find the height of the binary search tree.
- Find the number of nodes and leaves in the binary search tree.
- Traverse the binary search tree.
- Free the memory used by the binary search tree.
